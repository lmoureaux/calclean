This repository contains a small framework to remove noise from the CMS
calorimeters.

# Setup

There is no installation needed, you can just copy `calofilter.h` and `.cpp`
into your working directory. A static library can be built using `make` from
the root directory. This will also build a test application, but it expects a
data file to be in the right place.

The framework is compatible with ROOT (at least from version 5.34/30 onwards)
and any standard-compliant C++ 98 compiler. Any incompatibility should be
considered a bug.

# Documentation

The documentation is maintained as
[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) markup right inside
the source. You can download Doxygen from the repositories for your distribution
or from [here](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html). The
documentation can be generated by running

```bash
make doc
```

from the root directory. If you don't have `make`, you can try running Doxygen
directly:

```bash
doxygen
```

To open the generated documentation, point your favorite Web browser to
`doc/html/index.html`.
